= Plain Login - Example

This is the same as the plain php example, a single view handling the triple
jump.

the second example_token_repsonse.rb shows how to directly get an access_token e.g for js apps

== Usage

This does not use bundler, so you need to install the required gems.

  cd ruby/sinatra_plain
  bundle install
  ruby example.rb
  ruby example_token_response.rb
